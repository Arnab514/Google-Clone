# Google Clone - Next.js

This project is a pixel-perfect clone of Google's homepage and image search page, built using Next.js and TypeScript. The goal was to replicate the design and functionality of Google's core pages, while implementing key features like text search suggestions, image search functionality, and a responsive UI.

## Features
- **Pixel-perfect Google Homepage Clone**: A close replica of the Google homepage with all UI details and hover effects.
- **Text Search Functionality**: Includes a search bar with real-time suggestions. Hover effects and smooth dropdown animations are implemented.
- **Pixel-perfect Search by Voice**: A feature that allows users to search using voice input, closely replicating Google's voice search functionality. The voice search feature provides a smooth and responsive experience.
- **Image Search Page**: Clicking the camera icon opens a pop-up for uploading images. Image search results are displayed with placeholder data.
- **Image Cropping Tool**: Allows users to crop uploaded images and includes a glowing stars animation for enhanced UI.
- **Built with TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and prevent potential runtime issues.
